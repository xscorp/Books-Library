# Books-Library
A simple Books Library project written in C++

This is a CLI based Library Project which I wrote in first year of my college. This is coded in C++.
Since It is CLI based, It doesn't offer that good user interaction. However I have tried my best to make it a bit interactive.

Unlike many other Library Projects on the web, It support Book issueing function. That means a user(student) can issue a book and the record will be kept.
User can search a stored book either with book's ACC number or the name of the book.

# [USAGE]:

<ul>
      <li>Clone the entire project in your desired directory using:<br>
            <pre><i>git clone https://github.com/xscorp/Books-Library.git</i></pre><br>
      <li>Compile the code using:<br>
            <pre><i>gcc main.cpp -o libraryproject</i></pre><br>
      <li>Run the code using:<br>
            <b>Linux</b>:<pre> <i>./libraryproject</i><br></pre>
            <b>Windows</b>:<pre> <i>libraryproject</i><br></pre>
</ul>            


# [NOTES]:

<ul>
      <li>Initially there aren't any books stored in the file so you will find that the file "BOOKS.dat" is empty. Same case is with the "ISSUE_RECORDS.dat" file which contains the data of the students who issued books from library.<br>
      <li>The file "CREDITS.txt" is a just there for the information about who build this code, that is Me!<br>
      <li>There are a lot of bugs in it and I am already aware of it. I will try to fix them up once I get time.<br>
</ul>
