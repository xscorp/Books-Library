# Books-Library
A simple Books Library project written in C++

This is a CLI based Library Project which I wrote in first year of my college. This is coded in C++.
Since It is CLI based, It doesn't offer that good user interaction. However I have tried my best to make it a bit interactive.

Unlike many other Library Projects on the web, It support Book issueing function. That means a user(student) can issue a book and the record will be kept.
User can search a stored book either with book's ACC number or the name of the book.

# [USAGE]:

1. Clone the entire project in your desired directory.
2. Compile the code using:
      gcc main.cpp -o libraryproject
3. Run the code using:
Linux:  ./libraryproject
Windows: libraryproject


# [NOTES]:

1. Initially there aren't any books stored in the file so you will find that the file "BOOKS.dat" is empty. Same case is with the "ISSUE_RECORDS.dat" file which contains the data of the students who issued books from library.

2. The file "CREDITS.txt" is a just there for the information about who build this code, that is Me!

3. There are a lot of bugs in it and I am already aware of it. I will try to fix them up once I get time.
